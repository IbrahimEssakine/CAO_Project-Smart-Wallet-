# Description:

Introducing a revolutionary smart wallet with an intelligent card holder designed to fit all pocket types. This modern, rotating design simplifies usage and handling, complemented by an alarm system to alert in case of forgetfulness.

In the digital era, the transition from paper to small-sized cards for various purposes such as purchases, ticket payments, national identification, driver's licenses, etc., necessitates a wallet capable of securely accommodating all these cards.

Our invention features five metal plates linked to rotate around an axis. The first two rotate on the top axis, and the last two on the bottom axis. These four plates are dedicated to storing cards, with each plate holding a maximum of two cards. The intermediate plate, linked to others with screws, is designed for storing additional items like keys, memory cards, SIM cards, etc.

The smart wallet includes an RFID card to detect card presence. If any card is missing after 2 minutes and 30 seconds, a small alarm is triggered. It can be temporarily stopped for 2 minutes by clicking a hidden button or permanently stopped with a click exceeding 5 seconds, formatting the RFID card to its initial state.

The intermediate plate houses a flat wireless charging battery, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth card.

# Manufacturing:
The smart wallet is made of lightweight, rigid metal to protect cards while maintaining flexibility. It is assembled from four identical metal plates.

# Usage:
Upon obtaining the smart wallet, users should:

Identify each card using RFID to store their hexadecimal codes in the microcontroller's memory.
Connect the smart wallet and phone via Bluetooth.
Activate the phone's wireless charging mode to charge the smart wallet.

# Problems and Solutions:
Lost Wallet: An application can activate the wallet's alarm if the distance between the two is within 8 meters.
Low Battery Alert: If the battery reaches 10%, a 30-second alarm alerts the user.
Theft Prevention: The alarm activates if the smart wallet disconnects from the phone.

# Conception Using CATIA:
The smart wallet's conception was meticulously crafted using CATIA, a cutting-edge 3D modeling and simulation software. This advanced tool ensured precision in the design, allowing for a seamless integration of rotating mechanisms, metal plate alignments, and overall aesthetics.
